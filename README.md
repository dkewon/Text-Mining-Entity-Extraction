# Text-Mining-Entity-Extraction

## Objective
When you have a large volume of text files, extracting only relevant information is not so easy. It is complicated and time-consuming. 
However, with a Regular Expression (Regex), it is no longer a tedious job. 
In order to have a better understanding of current job market in the data analytics/science field, I used Regex and extracted only relevant information from the job description.
